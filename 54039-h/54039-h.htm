<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Encouraged</span> by the kindly manner in which the
Press has dealt with my "Anglo-Indian and Oriental
Cookery," and at the repeated request of friends, I
am writing this little book.</p>

<p>In its compilation, I have had in view both the
Anglican and Roman communions.</p>

<p>There are many who keep the Fasts and Abstinences
prescribed by their Church, and there are many more
who would do so if their food was served up and
cooked in a healthy way. As a rule, fish and vegetables
are very little understood in this country, and
even in the houses of the better class one sees little
else than the eternal boiled and fried fish. As to
vegetables, they are out of it altogether. If this be
the case where money is no object, how much harder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
is it for those who are obliged to make the most of
everything?</p>

<p>I do not pretend to teach in this little book, only
to give a few novel and useful recipes that most
housewives will find really good and economical, and
also to show that a non-flesh diet can be and is both
healthy and appetising.</p>

<p>The book will be found useful by others than those
for whom it is specially written, and most of the
recipes will be practicable at all times of the year.</p>

<p>A word in conclusion to the careful housewife in
getting tinned fish. Always get the <i>best</i> brand; it
is not wise to go in for cheap goods in this line.</p>

<p>I cannot speak too highly of Edwards' Desiccated
Soups. They make delicious soups of themselves,
and in conjunction with other things they have no
equal. Their tomato is simply invaluable; I would
not be without it for anything.</p>

<p>To those who find pastry indigestible I would
recommend them to try "Coombs' Eureka Flour";
it makes delicious pastry, and requires no baking
powder, and it has the advantage of being thoroughly
digestible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>I have mentioned how to use all these in most of
the recipes. I have not made any pretence to make
this what is called a high-class cookery book; my
aim and object is to bring it within the range of
most people, while many of the dishes are good
enough for any high-class table, and would be found
a welcome and novel addition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>


<h3>27. Sorrel Puree.</h3>

<p>Clean, pick, and wash two pounds of sorrel. Cut up an
onion into rings, chop two beads of garlic, and fry in three
ounces of butter a golden colour. Now add the sorrel. Let
it get quite soft, and pass it through a wire sieve, liquor and
all; add as much hot water as will make the <i>purée</i> a nice
consistence for soup. Pepper and salt to taste. Serve with
fried bread cut into dice.</p>


<h3>28. Artichoke Puree.</h3>

<p>Peel two pounds of Jerusalem artichokes, and boil them
till quite soft. Pass them through a wire sieve; add three
pints of milk; let it come to the boil, then add three ounces
of butter. Pepper and salt to taste. Serve with fried
bread. This is a delicious soup, and very nutritious.</p>


<h3>29. Carrot Puree.</h3>

<p>Scrape and wash four large carrots; cut them into quarters,
and boil till quite soft; pass them through a sieve;
cut up an onion into rings; chop up two beads of garlic,
and fry these with twenty-four cloves a nice brown in two
ounces of butter; then add the carrot <i>purée</i>, two and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
pints of water, three bay-leaves, a stick of cinnamon, a blade
of mace, one packet of Edwards' White Soup. Pepper and
salt to taste. Let it simmer gently for an hour. Strain
again, and serve with fried bread cut into dice. A few drops
of tarragon is an improvement.</p>


<h3>30. Pearl Sago Soup.</h3>

<p>Boil a quarter pound of pearl sago in two quarts of water
till quite clear, and as thick as possible; then add two
packets of Edwards' Tomato Soup, one onion stuck with
cloves, a roll of lemon peel, two white beads of garlic,
three bay-leaves, and three ounces of butter. Simmer gently
for one hour. Before serving remove the onion, garlic, peel,
and bay-leaves. Add a few drops of tarragon vinegar, one
tablespoon of Worcester sauce, and two of mushroom ketchup,
salt and pepper to taste.</p>


<p class="p1">N.B.&mdash;I have made some of these soups very thick on
purpose, so that there may be more substance in them.
They can, moreover, be made thinner or thicker as desired
by either omitting or adding hot water.</p>

<h2><i>SAUCES.</i></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">I give</span> but few, but these are novel to a certain extent.
The white butter sauce alone can be varied in many ways,
either savoury or sweet. If for sweets, the salt and
savouries left out, and sugar and flavouring as desired put
to it. Any cook with very little trouble can do this, and it
does not require extraordinary skill to vary these sauces
according to what is required.</p>


<h3>1. White Butter Sauce.</h3>

<p>Put into a pan half a pint of milk, with two ounces of
butter; let it gradually come to the boil.</p>

<p>Have ready a tablespoon of flour rubbed down in a
little cold milk. Add this to the boiling milk, stir, and
let it thicken, add salt to taste. This is more delicate than
the ordinary melted butter.</p>


<h3>2. Onion Sauce.</h3>

<p>Boil two large onions, stick two or three cloves into them.
When quite soft, pass them through a wire sieve, and add
the pulp to a sauce, as No. 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<h3>3. Parsley and Butter Sauce.</h3>

<p>Pick some parsley in neat bunches, wash and clear of
grit, dry thoroughly in a cloth, chop <i>very</i> fine, and add about
two tablespoons to the sauce No. 1. Let it simmer very
gently for a few minutes till the parsley is cooked; stir
occasionally, that it does not burn or get lumpy.</p>


<h3>4. Egg Sauce.</h3>

<p>Boil two eggs for ten minutes, then throw them in cold
water; shell and chop fine; add to sauce No. 1. A little
Nepaul pepper is an improvement.</p>


<h3>5. Sauce Piquant.</h3>

<p>Cut up a small onion, chop two beads of garlic, and fry
in two ounces of butter with twelve cloves, twelve peppercorns,
and three bay-leaves. Add half a pint of milk. Let
it slowly come to the boil.</p>

<p>Have ready one tablespoon of flour mixed smooth with a
little cold milk, stir into the boiling milk, strain, let it
cool a little; now add the yolk of an egg well beaten, a
little Nepaul pepper and salt to taste. And lastly, chop up
some tarragon and a little chervil that has been soaked in
vinegar for a week previously. Add this <i>very</i> carefully, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
little at a time, so that the sauce does not curdle. This
sauce is a great favourite.</p>


<h3>6. Bread Sauce.</h3>

<p>Boil a small onion till very tender, pass it through a
sieve; add to it half a pint of milk, two tablespoons of
bread crumbs passed through a sieve, two ounces of butter,
a few peppercorns, and salt to taste.</p>


<h3>7. Celery Sauce.</h3>

<p>Cut up the white part of a bead of celery very small.
Boil in just enough water to get it quite soft. Then add to
this two tablespoons of cream, two ounces of butter, and a
little flour mixed smooth in some cold milk, just to thicken
it, salt to taste. Some like a little grated lemon peel and
nutmeg.</p>


<h3>8. Oyster Sauce.</h3>

<p>Chop up half a dozen oysters and mix them with their
liquor with sauce No. 1&mdash;a little grated nutmeg and lemon
peel added.</p>


<h3>9. Shrimp Sauce.</h3>

<p>Pick and clean one pint of pink shrimps. Mix them with
sauce No. 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>


<h3>10. Lemon Sauce.</h3>

<p>Sauce No. 1. When a little cool, add the yolk of an egg
well beaten, the rind of half a lemon grated, a pinch of Nepaul
pepper and nutmeg.</p>


<h3>11. Anchovy and Butter Sauce.</h3>

<p>Sauce No. 1, with the addition of enough Anchovy sauce
to flavour nicely, and a pinch of Nepaul pepper.</p>


<h3>12. Jerusalem Artichoke Sauce.</h3>

<p>Sauce No. 1, with half a pound of artichokes boiled till
tender and passed through a sieve, added to it a good
pinch of Nepaul pepper.</p>


<h3>13. Brown Onion Sauce.</h3>

<p>Chop up an onion very small, also one bead of garlic.
Fry these in three ounces of butter, with one tablespoon
of flour, till it is quite brown. Add half a pint of water,
stir, and boil it up for about ten or fifteen minutes. Strain,
and add pepper and salt to taste, and a little mushroom
ketchup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<h3>14. Piquant Brown Sauce.</h3>

<p>Cut up an onion into rings; chop up two beads of garlic.
Fry these in three ounces of butter and a tablespoon of
flour till quite brown. Add rather less than half a pint of
water, two tablespoons of vinegar, one tablespoon of tarragon
vinegar, one tablespoon of chervil, one tablespoon of clove,
salt to taste, and a pinch of Nepaul pepper. Strain and
serve.</p>


<h3>15. Tomato Sauce.</h3>

<p>Cut up a small onion into thin rings, chop a bead of
garlic, and fry in two ounces of butter a pale yellow. Cut
up three good-sized tomatoes, and let it all simmer together
till quite soft. Pass it all through a fine wire sieve. Add
enough water to make half a pint of sauce. Thicken with
a little butter rolled in flour. Salt to taste and a few drops
of tarragon vinegar.</p>


<h3>16. Mushroom Sauce.</h3>

<p>Cut up a very small onion, chop one bead of garlic, and
fry in three ounces of butter, to which add a tablespoon of
flour. Fry till brown. Add half a pint of water, stir, and
let it thicken. Strain. Add salt and Nepaul pepper to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
taste, and about six good-sized mushrooms that have been
peeled and picked and chopped. Let it simmer for about
ten minutes very gently, and just before serving add a
tablespoon of mushroom ketchup and a squeeze of lemon.</p>


<h3>17. Brown Lemon.</h3>

<p>Cut up an onion into rings; chop up two beads of garlic.
Fry in three ounces of butter, with one tablespoon of flour,
a nice brown. Add half a pint of water, let it thicken, and
then strain it. Add the grated peel of half a lemon, the
juice of a whole one, and salt and Nepaul pepper to taste.</p>


<h3>18. Brown Parsley.</h3>

<p>Cut up an onion into thin rings, chop two beads of garlic,
and fry in three ounces of butter, with a tablespoon of
flour, till quite brown. Add half a pint of water, let it
thicken, and strain. Then add two tablespoons of finely
chopped green parsley, salt and Nepaul pepper to taste.</p>


<h3>19. Cocoa-nut Sauce.</h3>

<p>Cut up an onion into thin rings, chop two beads of garlic,
also two bay-leaves; fry these in three ounces of butter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
with twelve cloves and a tablespoon of flour; let it get
quite brown. Add the milk of a cocoa-nut and enough
water to make it half a pint; let it thicken, and strain,
then add two tablespoons of scraped cocoa-nuts, salt and
Nepaul pepper to taste. This is very good with boiled fish.</p>


<h3>20. Beet-root Sauce.</h3>

<p>Cut up an onion into rings, chop one bead of garlic, fry
in three ounces of butter with one tablespoon of flour.
Add somewhat less than half a pint of water, two tablespoons

<h2><i>FISH IN VARIOUS WAYS.</i></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> not given recipes for plain boiling and frying; most
cooks know how to do this perfectly well, and it would only
be repeating what is in other books. I will only add that
most of the sauces poured over plain boiled fish seem to
change its character entirely; for instance, boiled fillets of
skate smothered in onion sauce taste very much like white
meat. Some of the brown sauces, too, poured over good
firm fleshed fish, seem very much like chicken or rabbit.</p>

<p>I have put all the fish recipes together, both those suited to
<i>entrées</i> and the more substantial. I have done this because it
is rather a difficult matter to arrange how the different dishes
are to be served. Some are quite content with an <i>entrée</i>
after the soup; others want something more substantial to
take the place of the usual joint; they can, however, have
fish pies, baked fish, boiled fish, fried fish, etc., which
answer the purpose very well, and the lighter dishes can
be used as <i>entrées</i>, and some even as savouries. A dinner
of four or five courses can easily be had from these recipes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<h3>1. Eel Pie.</h3>

<p>Clean and skin two pounds of eels; cut them into pieces
two inches in length, put them in a pie dish thus: a layer of
fish, then sliced onions, a few cloves, and sliced tomatoes,
some sliced hard-boiled eggs, and so on till the dish is full.
Mix some salt and Nepaul pepper to taste, in a little warm
water, say a <i>small</i> tea-cup; pour it over the fish. Cover
with a nice crust either light or short, and bake a nice
brown. Serve with a nice frill round the dish.</p>

<p>This is a very substantial and delicious dish. The short
crust is more digestible and satisfying than the light, but
this is a matter of individual taste.</p>


<h3>2. Eel Stew.</h3>

<p>Clean and skin two pounds of eels; cut them into two-inch
pieces. Chop one onion and two beads of garlic very
small, fry in three ounces of butter with one tablespoon of
flour till it is a nice brown; add half a pint of water and let it
thicken; strain, then add the eels to the sauce. One tablespoon
of tarragon vinegar, one tablespoon of cloves, one
tablespoon of chervil, Nepaul pepper and salt to taste, the
grated rind of half a lemon, and a little grated nutmeg. A
few turned olives and button mushrooms considerably improve
it, but where expense is an object these may be left out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>


<h3>3. Salt Fish and Egg Pie.</h3>

<p>Get a good dry salt fish about three pounds. Soak it all
night in water, then put it in the oven till soft enough to
handle, remove all skin and bone, and make into nice large
flakes; put a layer of this in a pie dish, then a layer of sliced
onions, a few cloves, a sprinkling of lemon thyme, some
sliced hard-boiled eggs, and so on till the dish is full. Now
mix half a cup of water with half a cup of good thick
tomato conserve, add Nepaul pepper to it to taste; pour it
over the pie, and cover with either a light or a short crust,
and bake a nice brown.</p>


<h3>4. Salt Fish and Potato Pie.</h3>

<p>Treat the fish as in previous recipe. Peel and boil two
pounds of potatoes, mash them thoroughly, and mix them
with the fish. Three hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, one
tablespoon of chopped onion, three ounces of butter, and a
teaspoon of herbs as for veal stuffing. Mix all thoroughly
together, then put it in a well-greased pie dish, smooth it
down, and score it with a fork, put a few dabs of butter over
it here and there, and bake a nice brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<h3>5. Haddock and Potato.</h3>

<p>Get a good sized smoked haddock; put it in the oven for
a few minutes till it is cooked enough to handle, remove the
skin and bone, flake it, and mix it with mashed potatoes,
three ounces of butter, the grated peel of half a lemon, a
little lemon thyme, some grated nutmeg, and salt and
Nepaul pepper to taste. Put it in a greased pie dish;
smooth the top, and score it with a fork, and bake a nice
brown.</p>


<h3>6. Skate Fricassee.</h3>

<p>Cut up an onion into rings, chop one bead of garlic, fry
in two ounces of butter with twelve cloves and two bay-leaves,
a pale yellow. Add half a pint of milk, draw it
aside, and let the milk cook very gently ten minutes;
strain. Now mix smooth a tablespoon of flour with a little
cold milk; pour it into the other just as it is boiling up;
stir till it thickens. Add one pound of filleted skate, the
grated rind of half a lemon, a grated nutmeg; let it cook
gently till the fish is done. When a little cool, <i>i.e.</i>, when
it is off the boil, add the yolk of an egg well beaten, and salt
and Nepaul pepper to taste. Stir well, and thoroughly
warm it, taking care the egg does not curdle; it is best to
put the pan into a larger one containing hot water; this
prevents the curdling of the egg. Serve this with a dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of mashed potatoes, or potato snow. It is a delicate and
delicious dish and, skate being very nutritious, it is well
suited for an invalid.</p>


<h3>7. Skate Stew (Brown).</h3>

<p>Cut up an onion into thin rings, chop two beads of garlic,
and fry, in three ounces of butter with one tablespoon of
flour and twelve cloves, a nice brown, quite a rich colour,
then add half a pint of water, a blade of mace, a stick of
cinnamon, the grated rind of half a lemon, three bay-leaves;
stir, and let it thicken well, then add two tablespoons of
mushroom ketchup, Nepaul pepper and salt to taste; let it
simmer very gently for half an hour; strain, put it back in
the pan, and add one pound of nicely crimped skate to the
sauce; let the fish cook very gently until done, which will
take from twenty minutes to half an hour. Serve with
sippets of fried bread and parsley round the dish.</p>


<h3>8. Brown Oyster Stew.</h3>

<p>Make the sauce just the same as in preceding recipe, only
add the juice of the oysters to it; strain, and add the
oysters themselves. A few drops of tarragon and Chili<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
vinegar are an improvement, and the juice of half a lemon.
This is a delicate dish, and much liked.</p>


<h3>9. Lobster Cutlets.</h3>

<p>Well pound the flesh of a good fresh lobster in a mortar
(the best brand of tin lobster will answer as well), mix with
it about two ounces of butter, one small cup of bread
crumbs, salt and Nepaul pepper to taste, the grated rind of
a lemon and half a nutmeg grated, mix all together with
two well beaten eggs; form into cutlet shapes, and egg
and bread crumb them, fry a golden brown in boiling fat or
butter. Lay them on a sieve to drain off any fat there may
be. Serve neatly on a dish, and decorate with fried bread
and parsley.</p>


<h3>10. Oyster Cutlets.</h3>

<p>Stew one dozen oysters in their own liquor gently, till
tender enough to chop very small; mix with them one cup of
bread crumbs, some grated nutmeg and lemon peel, salt and
pepper to taste; bind all together with a well-beaten egg or
two, form into cutlets, and fry in butter a pale yellow;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
drain on a sieve. Serve with fried sippets of bread and
parsley round them. These are very delicious and simple.</p>


<h3>11. Oysters Fried on Toast.</h3>

<p>Take as many oysters as you need, dip each into well
beaten egg, and then into bread crumbs, fry in butter a
golden colour, sprinkle with pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Have ready as many pieces of fried bread, cut out with a
round cutter, as you have oysters, lay an oyster on each;
garnish the top with a sprinkling of chopped green parsley
and a piece or two of lemon cut in dice shape.</p>


<h3>12. Irish Cutlets.</h3>

<p>Remove the skin and bone from any cold fish you may
have remaining; well pound the flesh in a mortar; add one
cup of bread crumbs, salt and Nepaul pepper to taste, a
teaspoon of chopped onion, a teaspoon of chopped parsley,
mix all well together with one or two well beaten eggs, shape
into cutlets, sausages, or rounds, and fry a pale golden colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Serve neatly garnished with parsley, and slices of lemon on
a stand of potato.</p>

<p>Get a good sized smoked haddock, put it in the oven a few
minutes, pick out all bones and skin, pound the flesh in a
mortar, add one teaspoon chopped onion, one teaspoon of

pepper and salt to taste, one tea-cup of fine bread crumbs;
mix well, bind all with one or two well beaten eggs, form
into croquets, egg and bread crumb them, fry in butter a
delicate gold colour. Serve round a wall of mashed potatoes;
garnish with parsley and fried bread.</p>


<h3>14. Baked Fish.</h3>

<p>Get a good sized gurnet, stuff it with the following mixture;
tie it carefully round with tape (string cuts the fish),
put it in a baking tin, cover over with little dotes of butter
here and there and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Put it
into the oven, and bake till well done; remove the tape
carefully, so as not to spoil the look of the fish. Ornament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
with tufts of parsley, and serve with a dish of mashed
potatoes, or fried potato chips.</p>


<p class="pseudo-h3">Fish Stuffing.</p>

<p>One cup of fine bread crumbs, three ounces of butter well
worked in, one teaspoon of herbs, as for veal stuffing,
pepper and salt to taste, the yolks of two eggs. Mix all
well together, and stuff the fish neatly.</p>

plain boiled rice or as a kedgree, as per recipe given.</p>


<h3>27. White Cutlets.</h3>

<p>Well pound any cold white fish you may have in a
mortar. Add the grated peel of half a lemon, half a nutmeg
grated, pepper and salt to taste. Mix well. Then add a
well-beaten egg to bind the mixture, form into cutlets or
flat cakes, and poach in milk till set. Serve with shrimp
sauce over.</p>


<h3>28. Fish and Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Get some red or grey mullet. Plain boil, and serve
them in the middle of the dish. While hot melt some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
butter over them, and sprinkle with pepper and salt. Then
surround them with small baked tomatoes all round the
dish. Sprinkle over all some finely chopped parsley.
Serve with potato snow.</p>


<h3>29. Fish Mould.</h3>

<p>Well pound the flesh of some nice white fish. Mix with
it one cup of bread crumbs, one teaspoon of herbs as for
veal stuffing, three ounces of butter, the grated rind of
half a lemon, some grated nutmeg, Nepaul pepper and salt
to taste. Well beat four eggs. Mix all together, put in a
plain buttered mould, and bake till set. Turn out on to a
paper. Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon and
tomato.</p>


<h3>30. Lobster Mould.</h3>

<p>Well pound the contents of a tin of lobsters. Mix with
one cup of bread crumbs, one teaspoon of herbs, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
grated peel of half a lemon, some grated nutmeg, pepper
and salt to taste, three ounces of butter. Well beat three
eggs. Mix together, and put into a plain well-buttered
mould. Steam till quite set. Turn out on to a round dish.
Pour over a shrimp sauce.</p>


<p class="p1">N.B.&mdash;I have always said butter for all my fish dishes, as
the butter imparts a better flavour, and in these days it
can be had so cheaply; but if lard and dripping is substituted
by those who do not object to their use, it answers
quite as well.</p>

<h2><i>EGGS IN VARIOUS WAYS.</i></h2>


<h3>1. Tumbled Eggs.</h3>

<p>Put on half a pint of milk, with a piece of butter the
size of a walnut. Well beat up four eggs, add one teaspoon
of finely chopped onion, a little Nepaul pepper and
salt to taste. Stir into the milk; keep stirring all the time
till it gets thick. Then lay it on nicely buttered toast,
and serve neatly dished and decorated with parsley.</p>


<h3>2. Baked Eggs.</h3>

<p>Well grease a pie dish. Break into it as many eggs as
you require, taking care not to break the yolks. Sprinkle
over the top a light layer of bread crumbs, and pepper and
salt to taste. Put some dabs of butter here and there over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
it, and bake a nice golden colour. This dish, though simple,
is tasty and satisfying.</p>


<h3>3. Fricasseed Eggs.</h3>

<p>Have ready some hard-boiled eggs. Shell them, and cut
them in quarters. Place them in a dish neatly. Now
throw over them a white butter sauce, as per sauce recipe
No. 1. Sprinkle over some Nepaul pepper and salt to taste.
These should be eaten with toast sent to table separately.</p>


<h3>4. Dry Egg Currie.</h3>

<p>Chop four hard-boiled eggs very fine. Put them aside.
Chop up one onion, two beads of garlic, very fine. Fry in
three ounces of butter, with twelve cloves, a nice brown.
Then add a tablespoon of best currie powder. Fry all together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
a few minutes, and then add the minced eggs. Stir
well, and let all the moisture absorb. Add salt to taste,
and a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve with a separate dish of
boiled rice or kedgree, as per recipe given.</p>


<h3>5. White Egg Currie.</h3>

<p>Have ready some hard-boiled eggs; shell them and cut
them in half. Put them aside. Chop one onion and two
cloves of garlic small, and fry in three ounces of butter
with twenty-four cloves a pale yellow, then add one dessertspoon
of the best currie powder, the milk of a cocoa-nut,
and one small tea-cup of rich thick cream. Let it simmer
gently for about half an hour. Strain it, and then add salt
to taste, a squeeze of lemon, taking great care not to
curdle the cream, and lastly, add the eggs. Warm
thoroughly through. Serve with a separate dish of rice.</p>


<h3>6. Egg Zeste.</h3>

<p>Chop up six hard-boiled eggs small. Mix with them one
teaspoon of chopped onions, one teaspoon of chopped parsley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
one bead of garlic, <i>very</i> fine, Nepaul pepper and salt to
taste, the grated rind of a small lemon, and lastly, the
strained juice of the lemon. This is very nice eaten with
salads of any kind, or between bread and butter as a
sandwich.</p>


<h3>7. Baked Eggs with Cheese.</h3>

<p>Butter a pie dish, sprinkle it well over with grated Parmesan
cheese, a dust of Nepaul pepper and salt. Now
break in six eggs, cover over with grated cheese, a dust of
Nepaul pepper and salt, and bake a nice golden brown.</p>


<h3>8. Plain Omelette.</h3>

<p>Beat up the yolks of three eggs with two ounces of butter
quite smooth. Add to it pepper and salt to taste, and a
tablespoon of milk. Now beat the whites to a stiff froth,
and stir them thoroughly into the mixture. Put in just a
small pat of butter into a thoroughly clean frying-pan.
Pour in your mixture, and let it set and get a bright golden
yellow. Turn over neatly, lay it in a napkin, and garnish
with parsley. The chief secret is a clean pan and a perfectly
clear fire, which must not be too fierce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>


<h3>9. Omelette with Herbs.</h3>

<p>Just as previous one. Only add to the mixture one teaspoon
of chopped onion, and one teaspoon of parsley. Fry
the same as above, and serve on a napkin.</p>


<h3>10. Eggs with Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Well butter as many Darrol moulds (plain ones) as you
require, break an egg into each, carefully, add a dust of
pepper and salt, put a wee dab of butter on top, and bake
in the oven till nicely set. Have ready as many nice round
red tomatoes as you have eggs, put them in a greased
baking-tin, put a small dab of butter on each, dust them
with pepper and salt, and bake them till soft. Now dish
with an egg and a tomato alternately, and sprinkle over
all some chopped parsley. This is a simple but pretty and
tasty dish.</p>


<h3>11. Egg and Mushroom Souffle.</h3>

<p>Boil one ounce of semolina in one cup of milk till quite
thick, take it off the fire, stir into it while hot a piece of
butter the size of a walnut; let it get cool. When nearly
cold, stir in three well beaten eggs, yolks and whites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
separately, the whites beaten to a stiff froth. Add Nepaul
pepper and salt to taste. Well butter a plain border
mould, fill the mixture in, let it bake till well set and of a
nice colour. Have ready some mushrooms, prepared thus&mdash;pick
and skin them, and fry them in plenty of butter, and
pepper and salt, till quite soft and done. Turn out your
<i>soufflé</i> on to a paper, and fill in the centre with the fried
mushrooms; sprinkle over the whole a little chopped
parsley. Serve very hot.</p>


<h3>12. Egg Balls.</h3>

<p>Boil some eggs hard, take out the yolks, pound them in a
mortar, mix with equal proportion of fine bread crumbs
passed through a wire sieve, add a teaspoon of fine chopped
onion, one bead of garlic, one teaspoon of parsley, one ounce
of butter; mix well; bind the mixture with well beaten raw
egg, form into balls, fry a nice brown, and serve strung on
skewers.</p>


<h3>13. Egg Cutlets.</h3>

<p>Chop some hard-boiled eggs fine. Mix them with an
equal quantity of fine bread crumbs. Add pepper and salt
to taste. Bind the mixture with well beaten raw eggs.
Form into nice shaped cutlets, and fry in butter a bright
golden yellow. Serve neatly, and garnish with fried parsley
and sippets of bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>


<h3>14. Surprise Eggs.</h3>

<p>Boil as many eggs as you need hard. Cut a very small
piece off the pointed end, so that the egg can stand, and
then cut off as little as possible of the end&mdash;just enough to
be able to take out the yolk nicely. If the white is very
thick, thin it with a sharp knife, but be <i>very</i> careful not to
spoil the shape. Pound the yolks in a mortar. Mix with
them one or two anchovies also pounded, a bit of butter,
some Nepaul pepper, a few fine bread crumbs. Mix well
together, form the mixture into little balls, and proceed to
fill the whites of the eggs, so that it looks somewhat like
the yolk inside. Now have ready a nice salad made of
lettuce, endive, tarragon, and chervil, chopped very fine, and
looking like a bed of moss. On this set the eggs, and
ornament with chopped beet-root. This is a very pretty
dish, and exceedingly tasty, and suitable for breakfast, lunch,
or dinner.</p>


<h3>15. Stewed Eggs.</h3>

<p>Have a nice, tasty brown sauce, as No. 17. Put to it as
many hard-boiled eggs as you want, cut in half some turned
olives, and a few button mushrooms. Let it warm
thoroughly through, and serve, ornamented with fried sippets
of bread.</p>

<h2><i>LENTILS, RICE, AND MACARONI
IN VARIOUS WAYS.</i></h2>


<h3>1. Lentil Moulds.</h3>

<p>Boil half a pint of lentils in one pint of water till quite

<h3>5. Haricot Bean Pie.</h3>

<p>Boil one pint of haricot beans till quite soft, put a mite of
soda in the water to soften it, when quite done drain and set
aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut up an onion into rings, chop up two beads of garlic;
fry these in three ounces of butter with twenty-four cloves a
nice golden colour. Now add one teaspoon of the best currie
powder, and one cup of tomato pulp. Mix well, then add
Nepaul pepper and salt to taste, a few drops of tarragon
vinegar; put in your beans, and mix well. Turn out in a pie
dish, and let them cool. Cover with a nice homely short
crust, and bake a nice golden brown. This pie is nutritious,
and really nice.</p>


<h3>6. Haricot Bean Stew.</h3>

<p>Boil one pint of beans till quite soft, drain, and set them
aside. Make a thorough tasty brown sauce, as Nos. 16 or

<h3>7. Haricot Bean Currie.</h3>

<p>Boil the beans as in previous recipe; cut up an onion and

and decorate with parsley and small sliced tomatoes.</p>


<h3>9. Plain Boiled Rice.</h3>

<p>In boiling rice as it should be done, observe the following
directions, and success is bound to follow:&mdash;(1) Use the
best rice only. (2) Do not be afraid of plenty of water,
four quarts to one pound. (3) Put in the rice as the water
comes to the boil, having put in a good teaspoon of salt
before you add the rice. (4) Watch carefully the <i>moment</i>
the rice is soft, drain <i>at once</i> and set before the fire to steam
for about half an hour or more; by this means your rice
will be grain from grain separate, and look most appetising.
These remarks apply to the cooking of rice in every form,
when it is required dry, and to eat with savouries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h3>10. Yellow Rice.</h3>

<p>Never throw away the water in which kedgrees or yellow
rice have been boiled. They make delicious soups on meat
days, with the addition of a little Armour's Beef Extract,
as the stock is already flavoured and thickened; or it will
make a delicious mullagatawny soup with the addition of
currie powder, and made according to recipe No. 9 (Soups),
without the herrings, and using the liquor instead. This
applies equally to the water in which haricot beans and
peas have been boiled. It always makes good stock for
soup.</p>

<p>Boil in the water you put on for your rice one large
onion whole, three beads of garlic whole, twenty-four
cloves, the seeds of twelve cardamoms, three
bay-leaves, two sticks of cinnamon, two blades of
mace, and a pennyworth of saffron, one heaped up teaspoon
of salt. Let these come to the boil, and then
add one pound of the best rice. Watch carefully. Taste
it from time to time. The moment the rice is soft drain
at once, and set before the fire to steam. Before serving
remove the onion, garlic, bay-leaves, cinnamon, and mace,
but <i>not</i> the cloves and cardamoms. Decorate with onions
fried crisp and brown, sultanas fried, and almonds blanched
and fried. This is very nice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>


<h3>11. Kedgree.</h3>

<p>Put on some water with all the flavourings of the previous
recipe, omit the saffron. When it comes to the boil
add half a pound of pink lentils that have been well washed.
When these change colour and get yellow, which will take
about five minutes, add half a pound of best rice; stir well,
and watch carefully. The moment the rice is done enough
drain at once, and set before the fire to steam. Remove
the spices, etc., as before, and decorate in the same way.</p>


<h3>12. Another Kedgree.</h3>

<p>Do some rice as yellow rice recipe. Add to it some
flaked smoked haddock, and one teaspoon of herbs as for
veal stuffing, and two ounces of butter. Mix well loosely
with a fork. Serve hot, and decorate with hard-boiled
eggs cut in quarters, and onions fried crisp and brown.</p>


<h3>13. Another Kedgree.</h3>

<p>The same as No. 11. Add to it four hard-boiled eggs
chopped fine, two ounces of butter. Mix well lightly with
a fork, and serve, decorated in the usual way with fried
onions brown and crisp and fried almonds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h3>14. Tomato Rice.</h3>

<p>Cut up an onion into thin rings, chop two beads of garlic,
also two bay-leaves; fry this in three ounces of butter with
twenty-four cloves a nice pale yellow. Now add one cup
of tomato pulp, salt and Nepaul pepper to taste, a few
drops of tarragon vinegar. Stir well; let it simmer for
about twenty minutes; strain, and pour the sauce over
some cold rice you may have by you; cover up, and warm
thoroughly through. Serve decorated with bright West
Indian pickles.</p>


<h3>15. Cheese Pillau.</h3>

<p>Boil some rice, with all the flavouring as for "yellow
rice." Remove the spices, etc. Add two ounces of butter
and three ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, Nepaul pepper
and salt to taste. Mix all lightly with a fork. Dish
garnished with watercress.</p>


<h3>16. Rice Savoury.</h3>

<p>Any cold rice you may have by you may do for this dish.
Well beat up two eggs with a little milk; mix with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
small onion chopped, one small bead of garlic, one teaspoon
of chopped parsley, one teaspoon mixed of lemon thyme,
tarragon and chervil, Nepaul pepper and salt to taste. Mix
all well together. Put it into a plain mould well buttered;
put it in the oven till well set. Turn out on to a paper.
Garnish with tufts of parsley and small red tomatoes.</p>


<p class="p1">N.B.&mdash;Rice can be cooked any colour, by simply adding
a harmless vegetable colouring to the water in which it is
boiled, and thus it looks very pretty served with stewed
fruits, etc., as it makes the simplest thing look appetising
and nice. Any cook with very little ingenuity could turn
out any number of pretty and tasty dishes of rice alone; it
has the advantage of being nutritious and digestible, and is
about the most economical thing there is in the market.</p>


<h3>17. Macaroni Savoury.</h3>

<p>Boil as much macaroni as you require, in salt and water.
When tender, drain, and put it aside.</p>

<p>Cut up an onion into very thin rings, chop two beads of
garlic small, fry in three ounces of butter with twenty-four
cloves a pale yellow, then add one cup of tomato pulp; stir
well; the grated rind of half a lemon, Nepaul pepper and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
salt to taste, a few drops of tarragon vinegar; pour over
the macaroni, and warm thoroughly through. This is a
delicious and most digestible dish. Garnish with watercress
in bunches round the dish, and serve.</p>


<h3>18. Macaroni Cheese.</h3>

<p>Boil some macaroni plain. Put it in a well-buttered pie
dish thus&mdash;a layer of macaroni, a layer of grated Parmesan
cheese, a sprinkling of mustard and salt, till the dish is full
on the top, sprinkle the cheese. Beat up three eggs well in
one pint of milk, pour it over the macaroni, and well cover
it. Put a few dabs of butter over it here and there, and
put it in the oven, and bake a bright golden brown. Serve,
decorated with a nice frill round the dish.</p>


<h3>19. Curried Macaroni.</h3>

<p>Boil some macaroni. Put it aside. Cut up an onion into
thin rings, chop up two beads of garlic, fry in three ounces
of butter with twenty-four cloves a delicate brown. Now
add one tablespoon of best currie powder, one cup of tomato
pulp, the grated rind of half a lemon, and the strained juice
of half a lemon, salt to taste. Pour the sauce over the
macaroni, and serve thoroughly hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h3>20. Macaroni Savoury.</h3>

<p>Boil some macaroni, cut it into short lengths of about
two inches long, well beat up three eggs. Mix with them
one teaspoon of chopped onion, one teaspoon of herbs as for
veal stuffing, one teaspoon of chopped parsley, Nepaul
pepper and salt to taste. Mix it thoroughly with one cup
of milk, and stir it well into the macaroni. Pour it into
a pie dish, put a few dabs of butter over the top here and
there, and bake a nice brown.</p>


<p class="p1">N.B.&mdash;Vermicelli answers all the same purpose as macaroni.
Some like it better and think it more delicate; both
are cheap and nutritious, and both are capable of manipulation
in a great many ways.</p>

mash them with a fork. Add one cup of fine bread crumbs,
some chopped sage to taste, two ounces of butter, pepper
and salt. Mix well, and stuff the marrows. Now steam
the marrows till nearly done. Have ready some good
brown sauce, as recipe No. 14, finish cooking your marrows in
that. Dish neatly, and pour the sauce round them. A
separate boat of apple sauce to eat with them is liked by
some.</p>


<h3>13. Marrows on Toast.</h3>

<p>Peel and cut into quarters some nice young marrows.
Put the pieces into a jar with some butter, pepper and salt.
Cover the jar close, and put it into the oven. Let the
marrows cook in their own steam. When done place them
on nicely cut pieces of buttered toast; sprinkle over them
pepper and salt. These are really delicious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>


<h3>14. Stewed Cabbage Stalks.</h3>

<p>Get good thick stalks; cut away all the outside, till you
come to the tender part inside; cut these into two-inch
lengths. Parboil them in a little salt and water, and then
finish cooking them, in either a white sauce as No. 1 recipe,
or brown as No. 14 recipe. Either way they are truly
delicious, and by far the best part of the cabbage in flavour
and goodness.</p>


<h3>15. Spinach with Eggs.</h3>

<p>Well pick and wash some spinach; put it in a pan with
only the water that is in the leaves; let it boil till quite
tender. Mash it with a fork with a little butter, pepper and
salt. Put some on pieces of neatly cut buttered toast, then
on each piece lay a well poached egg. Sprinkle over with
pepper and salt, and serve.</p>


<h3>16. Spinach Indian Way.</h3>

<p>Wash and cook some spinach as before. Put it aside.
Cut up an onion into rings, and fry in two ounces of
butter a pale yellow. Put in your spinach; stir well: add
Nepaul pepper and salt to taste. This may be eaten on
toast, or with plain boiled rice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>


<h3>17. Farced Parsnips.</h3>

<p>Parboil some nice young parsnips. Scoop out the inside,
and stuff with a farce of fish made thus&mdash;boil
a salt haddock, remove all skin and bone, pound
the flesh in a mortar. Add one teaspoon of herbs as for
veal stuffing, Nepaul pepper to taste, a small cup of bread
crumbs, some butter and a teaspoon of chopped onions;
bind the whole with well beaten eggs, and stuff your
parsnips. Now finish cooking by steaming them. Serve
neatly on a dish, and pour over them either a brown sauce
as No. 14, or white as No. 1, whichever is liked best.</p>


<h3>18. Farced Carrots.</h3>

<p>Parboil some nice sized carrots. Scoop out the inside,
and stuff with a farce as for lentil moulds, recipe No. 1.
Finish cooking by steaming them, and then pour over a
tomato sauce, as recipe No. 15, and serve.</p>


<h3>19. Vegetable Stew.</h3>

<p>Cut up an onion into rings, chop two beads of garlic, and
fry in three ounces of butter with twenty-four cloves; let it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
get a nice golden colour. Now add sliced potatoes, carrots,
turnips, parsnips, and pour over all one pint of water, two
tablespoons of mushroom ketchup, salt and Nepaul pepper to
taste. Cook till the vegetables are quite tender, and serve.</p>

<p>This is quite as nice as Irish stew with meat in it.</p>


<h3>20. Farced Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Scoop out the middle of the tomato with great care. Put
into it a farce made thus&mdash;one small cup of bread crumbs,
one teaspoon of herbs as for veal stuffing, two ounces of
butter, pepper and salt to taste; bind with the yolk of one
or two well beaten eggs. Stuff your tomatoes, put a little
dab of butter on the top of each, sprinkle with pepper and
salt, and bake in the oven till soft. Dish neatly; sprinkle
over them some chopped green parsley. These may be
served on pieces of fried bread. They are very nice served
thus.</p>


<h3>21. Mushroom and Olive Stew.</h3>

<p>Make a nice brown sauce as recipe No. 14. Add to it
some turned olives, and some nice button mushrooms.
Garnish the dish with fried sippets of bread and chopped
green parsley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>


<h3>22. Mushrooms on Toast.</h3>

<p>Well pick and clean some mushrooms, fry in about four
ounces of butter, with pepper and salt to taste. Cook till
the mushrooms get quite black. Serve on neatly cut pieces
of toast; heap them one on the other, and garnish with tufts
of parsley.</p>


<h3>23. Celery Stew.</h3>

<p>Cut up some nice tender stalks of celery into three-inch
pieces, parboil in milk, then put it into a sauce as recipe
No. 1, and finish cooking thus&mdash;add the grated rind of
half a lemon, the grate of a nutmeg, Nepaul pepper and
salt to taste. Lay this on nicely trimmed slices of toast,
and serve. The celery may be stewed in a brown sauce, as
per recipe No. 14, instead of the white; it is nice either
way.</p>


<h3>24. Sea-Kale Stew.</h3>

<p>Serve the same as celery, or plain boil, and pour over a
good white butter sauce, in which a little cream has been
mixed, to make it extra rich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>


<h3>25. Stewed Green Peas.</h3>

<p>Shell your peas, and put them into a jar. Add two
ounces of butter, a little pepper and salt, and one saltspoon
of sugar; cover close, and put into the oven to cook in
their own steam. When quite done, turn out into a dish,
pour over them a good brown sauce, as No. 14, add a teaspoon
of chopped green mint, and serve.</p>


<h3>26. Stewed French Beans.</h3>

<p>Get some tender French beans, cut them in two or three
pieces each across, <i>not</i> lengthways, cook the same as peas in
a jar, omitting the sugar. Turn out on a dish, and pour
over them a brown parsley sauce, as recipe No. 18.</p>


<h3>27. French Beans on Toast.</h3>

<p>Get some very young French beans, put them in whole in
a jar, with butter, pepper and salt, and a mite of soda to
preserve the colour. Cook them as in previous recipe.
Turn them out when done, and lay on neatly cut slices of
well buttered toast. Sprinkle over with pepper and salt,
and serve very hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<h3>28. Stewed Broad Beans.</h3>

<p>Well boil some broad beans in salt and water; take off
the skins, and pour over the beans a parsley and butter
sauce, as recipe No. 3. These may be served on toast, and
thus make a substantial dish, and very nice.</p>


<h3>29. Jerusalem Artichokes on Toast.</h3>

<p>Peel very carefully and trim nicely; throw them into
cold water as you peel them, or they will get discoloured.
Boil in salt and water till quite soft; drain; mash them
with a fork till quite smooth, with butter, pepper and salt.
Put the artichokes thickly on nicely cut pieces of buttered
toast, and sprinkle with pepper and salt, and serve. This
is simply delicious, though simple.</p>


<h3>30. Egg Plant Savoury.</h3>

<p>Cut up some egg plants into quarters; put them into a
jar, with butter, pepper and salt; cover close, and put in
the oven. When done, take them out, mash them smooth
with a fork. Add two hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, and a
few bread crumbs, fill the mixture with little scallop shells,
brush over the top of each with well beaten egg, sprinkle on
some fine bread crumbs, put a little dab of butter on each,
and just put in the oven to brown. Serve them in the
shells, neatly dished.</p>

<h2><i>SALADS IN VARIOUS WAYS.</i></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">These</span> are very little understood in this country. Almost
any vegetable cold can be made into a most appetising
salad. By this means you have really delicious dishes, and
there is no waste of cold vegetables or fish. I will give a
few which, though known, are very seldom used, and I
want to impress the fact in the minds of my readers that
salads are healthy and economical, and generally liked by
young and old, and the very little trouble they take in preparation
is well repaid by the result.</p>


<h3>1. Potato Salad.</h3>

<p>Mash up any cold potatoes you may have, mix them with
any cold fish. Add a tablespoon of best olive oil, some caper
vinegar, and a few chopped capers, one teaspoon of chopped
onions, one bead of garlic chopped very small, the grated
rind of a small lemon, the juice of half a lemon strained,
salt and Nepaul pepper to taste; mix thoroughly. Serve
it in a glass dish neatly piled up, smooth with a fork.
Sprinkle over the whole some chopped hard-boiled egg, and
arrange pretty West Indian pickles over it for decoration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>


<h3>2. Plain Potato Salad.</h3>

<p>Cut up any cold potatoes in slices, mix with them a teaspoon
of chopped onion, a teaspoon of chopped parsley, and
pour over it equal quantities of best olive oil and vinegar
that has been well mixed with a little pepper and salt.</p>


<h3>3. Mixed Vegetable Salad.</h3>

<p>Cold carrots, turnips, potatoes, green peas, French beans,
beet-root, celery, cauliflower, etc. Cut the carrots, turnips,
potatoes, etc., with a nice fancy vegetable cutter; mix in
the green peas, the French beans cut up in two or three
pieces each, the cauliflower in neat little branches. Mix
with them a teaspoon of chopped onion, a teaspoon of
chopped parsley; mix equal quantities of vinegar and best
olive oil, with pepper and salt to taste; toss all lightly up together.
Ornament with lettuce and watercress in bunches.</p>


<p class="p1">N.B.&mdash;German lentils, green peas, French beans, broad
beans, all make a good salad by themselves with equal
quantities of oil and vinegar, and pepper and salt. No
cold vegetable is out of place.</p>

<p>Every one more or less knows how to make salads from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
lettuce, endive, watercress, radishes, mustard and cress, etc.,
etc.; so it would be useless to enter into that in this little
book. I will, however, give directions for a few simple
salad sauces that I find generally approved of.</p>


<h3>4. Salad Sauce No. 1.</h3>

<p>Boil some eggs hard, two or three will be enough, take
out the yolks, bruise them with the back of a spoon quite
smooth, add a teaspoon of made mustard. Mix well, then
add two tablespoons of olive oil, a little at a time, till well
mixed, then two tablespoons of vinegar, stirring all the
while. Lastly, a few drops of tarragon vinegar, a few drops
of garlic vinegar, a salt spoon of castor sugar, and salt to
taste. Some like a spoonful of anchovy sauce added; this
is, of course, a matter of taste.</p>


<h3>5. Sauce No. 2.</h3>

<p>Break in the yolks of three eggs into a basin, stir with a
wooden spoon, with two tablespoons of olive oil, but a drop
at a time only till the egg gets thick; then mix in two
tablespoons of vinegar gradually, a few drops of tarragon, a
few drops of garlic, a spoonful of made mustard, and, lastly,
two tablespoons of cream, but this must be mixed with great
care so that it does not curdle. Salt to taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>


<h3>6. Sauce No. 3.</h3>

<p>One potato passed through a sieve, the hard-boiled yolk
of one egg rubbed smooth, two tablespoons of olive oil, two
tablespoons of vinegar, a few drops of tarragon vinegar, a
few drops of garlic vinegar, and a few drops of Chili
vinegar; mix all well and smoothly. Add salt to taste.</p>


<p class="p1">N.B.&mdash;All salads should have a dash of onion and garlic,
but very judiciously mixed. The difference in the flavour of
the salads is very great.</p>

<p>Green salads may be mixed with lobsters, anchovies,
sardines, and any kind of cold fish.</p>

<h2><i>PUDDINGS AND SWEETS.</i></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">I find</span> the generality of ordinary puddings are dreadfully
insipid. It is not at all necessary that this should be the
case. And flavouring is cheap enough. Appearance, too,
is a great thing. The sense of sight, smell, and taste can
easily enough be gratified with very little trouble. And
when one takes into consideration that our health depends
on the way in which our food is prepared, it becomes an
actual matter of duty to take the necessary trouble to prepare
it properly, and bringing both intelligence and taste
to bear on the subject.</p>


<h3>1. Currant and Apple Tart.</h3>

<p>Make a nice short crust of Coombs' Eureka Flour, thus&mdash;half
a pound of flour, three ounces of butter, one egg well
beaten, a pinch of salt, and one teaspoon of castor sugar.
Make it into a nice dough with milk. Put in a pie dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
one layer of dry currants well washed and picked, a little
grated lemon peel, and a few drops of lemon juice, then a
spoonful of treacle and a few very fine bread crumbs, then a
layer of sliced fresh apples, and again the currants, and so
on till the dish is full. Cover with the paste rolled thin,
and ornament prettily on the top with the paste nicely cut
out, etc., etc. Bake a nice golden brown, and when a little
cool sprinkle castor sugar over the top. Serve with a nice
custard or cream.</p>


<h3>2. Cabul Cassalettes.</h3>

<p>Put half a pound of dried apricots to soak for about four
hours, pour the water in which they have been soaked into
an enamel saucepan, about a cupful. Add half a pound of
sugar, a little grated lemon peel, and the juice of half a
lemon. Let it get into a syrup, then add the fruit, and let
it simmer gently for one hour. Make a nice puff paste of
Coombs' Eureka Flour, roll out thin, and line some nice
shaped patty pans, well greased, with the paste; prick it
with a fork to prevent it blistering. Put it in a quick
oven and bake a pretty golden brown, turn out of the pans,
and fill the cases with the apricot stew; then <i>well</i> whip
some cream very stiff, put it smoothly over the top of each,
so that it looks like white foam, and then sprinkle over all
either crushed crystallised violets or chopped pistachio
nuts. Both are pretty, or do half with the violets and half
with the nuts. Arrange them neatly in a glass dish, with
a dish paper under. These are very pretty, and very
delicious, and simple to make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>


<h3>3. Fried Almond Rings.</h3>

<p>Make a paste thus&mdash;half a pound of Coombs' Eureka
Flour, two ounces of butter, two ounces of sugar, a quarter
pound of almonds ground to a paste. Mix well together.
Add one well-beaten egg, with just enough milk to make
the mixture into a good dough, roll out about a quarter of
an inch thick, stamp out some rounds about the size of the
top of a tumbler, then take some smaller rounds and stamp
out the inside so as to form rings. Fry these rings in a
bath of boiling lard a pale golden colour, drain them on a
sieve, and sprinkle well over with castor sugar. Serve on
a dish paper neatly. The inner rounds may be put on a
well floured baking tin, and baked in the oven as biscuits.
So there need be no waste. They are nice both ways.</p>


<h3>4. Digestible Plum Pudding.</h3>

<p>Put one tablespoon of crushed loaf sugar into a pan.
Let it get quite brown, but do not let it burn. Add to it
one pint of hot milk; stir well till the sugar dissolves in
the milk. Have ready three ounces of fine florador dissolved
in enough milk to make it like thick cream; stir this
into the milk as it is on the point of boiling. Let it get
very thick; stir in two ounces of fresh butter, quarter a
pound of sultanas washed and picked, quarter a pound of
currants washed and picked, two ounces of citron peel
chopped small, half a grated nutmeg, the grated rind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
half a lemon, two well beaten eggs; stir all well (but do
not put in the eggs till the pudding is a little cool, as they
will curdle), put it in a well greased plain mould, and steam
till well set and firm. Turn out on a dish, and ornament
with <i>glacé</i> cherries, angelica, etc., etc. This is a very
digestible plum pudding, and may be safely eaten by invalids,
who dare not touch ordinary plum pudding. It is
in the opinion of some very much nicer than the usual
Christmas puddings.</p>


<h3>5. Plain Florador Pudding.</h3>

<p>Put one tablespoon of crushed loaf sugar into a pan.
Let it get brown, but do not let it burn, then add one pint
of hot milk. Have ready three ounces of fine florador
(semolina will do) mixed with enough milk to make it like
thick cream, stir it into the milk just as it comes to the
boil, let it thicken, then add two ounces of butter, a little
more sugar to taste, and any flavouring approved of. Turn
it into a pie dish, and bake in the oven a nice brown on
the top. Let it cool a little, and sprinkle over the top
some hundreds of thousands, and serve.</p>


<h3>6. Boiled Banana Pudding.</h3>

<p>Make a crust thus&mdash;a half pound of Coombs' Eureka Flour,
a pinch of salt, and a quarter pound of chopped suet. Mix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
well with enough water to form it into a dough, roll out
thin, line a plain well-greased pudding mould with the
paste, and fill in thus&mdash;some nice ripe bananas cut in slices,
a few cloves, the grated rind of half a lemon, the juice of
one lemon strained, one tablespoon of castor sugar, a small
cup of water. Cover over the top with paste, tie with a
cloth wrung out of boiling water. Steam for about two
hours. Turn out carefully, and serve with a nicely
flavoured custard.</p>


<h3>7. Banana Custard.</h3>

<p>Well mash two bananas into a complete pulp. Put with
one pint of milk and the well beaten yolks of three eggs
sugar and vanilla flavouring to taste. Stir well. Put it
into a pan, and put the pan into a larger one with boiling
water in it. Stir all the time for twenty minutes, and
pour it into custard cups. This is very delicious and
novel.</p>


<h3>8. Cocoa-nut Rice.</h3>

<p>Boil a quarter pound of small rice in one pint of milk till
quite soft. Then add two ounces of butter, sugar to taste,
and three ounces of desiccated cocoa-nut. Stir well, and
pour into a plain mould that has been rinsed with cold
water. Let it get cold. Turn out of the mould into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
glass dish, decorate with pretty sweets, such as those sold
by Messrs. Clark Nicholls and Coombs, or Mr. E. Roberts
of Camberwell.</p>


<h3>9. Cocoa-nut Macaroni.</h3>

<p>Boil half a pound of macaroni in water till tender,
drain, put it in a pie dish. Mix with it a quarter pound of
desiccated cocoa-nut. Well beat up two eggs with rather
more than a half pint of milk, with sugar to taste. Pour
it over the macaroni, and see that it is well covered. Put
a little dab of butter here and there over it. Bake it in
the oven a nice colour. Let it cool a little, and sprinkle
castor sugar over it, or any pretty fruits.</p>

<p>Vermicelli will answer the purpose quite as well.</p>


<h3>10. Cream Rolls.</h3>

<p>Get as many nice plain, round, smooth, little rolls as you
may require. Cut a little piece off the top of each with
care; now scoop out the crumbs out of each with very great
care, and also take off any crumbs there may be on the
pieces cut off the tops. Well beat two eggs with about one
cup of milk. Add a little sugar to taste. Put the custard
in a bowl, dip each roll and the piece cut off in the custard,
but not enough to moisten it so that it gets too soft. Now
fry all of them in a bath of boiling lard a nice golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
brown. Drain on a sieve. When cold, fill each one up
thus&mdash;a little guava jelly at the bottom, and then cream
whipped stiff and flavoured with a little sugar, the grated
peel of half a lemon, and a little lemon juice. Then put on
the top that was cut off, sprinkle over with castor sugar.
Serve on a dish paper. These are delicious.</p>


<h3>11. Semolina Cup Puddings.</h3>

<p>Put on one pint of milk in the pan, with two ounces of
fresh butter and sugar to taste, and some grated rind of
lemon to taste. Have ready about three ounces of semolina
mixed with enough milk to make it like thick cream. Pour
it into the milk just as it comes to the boil; stir well, and
let it get very thick. Pour into very small cups that have
been rinsed in cold water. When cold, turn out in a glass
dish, neatly, and pour over it a nicely flavoured custard,
and grate over the top a little nutmeg. Each cup can be
decorated with dried fruit if desired, but it is very simple
and nice as it is.</p>


<h3>12. Cream Cake Pudding.</h3>

<p>Make a cake thus&mdash;one pound of Coombs' Eureka Flour,
a quarter pound of sugar, a quarter pound of butter. Mix well
together; add three well beaten eggs with enough milk to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
make the mixture like very thick whipped cream. Pour it
into a well-buttered quite plain pudding mould (tin), bake
a nice colour, let it stand about ten minutes, and then turn
out. Next day scoop out all the inside, leaving a wall of
cake about one and a half inches thick; fill this up as
follows&mdash;a layer of strawberry jam, then a layer of thick
cream, till it is filled up; cover the top with cream, and
smooth with a wet palette knife; decorate the top with two
nice strawberry sweets in the middle, and some half moon
almond paste sweets laid round the edges, either plain or
interlaced, by putting a second round over the first, then
stick three long pieces of angelica, and make a tripod handle.
This is pretty and nice.</p>


<h3>13. Boiled Vermicelli Pudding.</h3>

<p>Boil a quarter pound of Vermicelli in about half a pint of
milk till soft, sweeten a little, then make a custard thus&mdash;two
eggs well beaten, half a pint of milk, vanilla to taste,
also a little castor sugar. Pour the custard over the
vermicelli; stir well together; pour it into a mould that has
been well greased. Steam for about one hour or more till quite
set. Take great care in turning it out, as it is apt to break.
Ornament with dried cherries cut in half, and chopped
pistachio nuts, or with pretty sweets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>


<h3>14. Florador Custard Pudding.</h3>

<p>Boil one pint of milk. Have ready two ounces of fine
florador, mixed with enough milk to make it like cream;
stir this into the milk as it comes to the boil; let it thicken.
Now take it off the fire; stir in two ounces of fresh butter,
sugar and flavouring to taste. Well beat up three eggs,
and when the florador is cooled a little, mix in the eggs
with it. Pour into a pie dish, and bake in the oven till set
and of a nice golden brown. When a little cool, sprinkle
over the top a little castor sugar that has been made a
pretty pink by adding a drop of cochineal to it in a dry
state, and rubbing it with the fingers.</p>


<h3>15. Orange Fritters.</h3>

<p>Get two or three nice large oranges, peel them carefully
so as not to break the inner part. Divide into skeins, and
carefully take off all the white pithy part, but on no account
break the skin. Make a batter thus&mdash;quarter
pound of flour, the yolks of two raw eggs, one tablespoon
of olive oil. Mix it with enough cold water to
make it a stiff batter. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff
froth, with a pinch of salt, and add this to the batter; stir
and use; dip each skein of orange in it, and fry in a bath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of boiling lard a nice golden brown; drain on a sieve. Serve
on a dish paper, and sprinkle all over with castor sugar;
better still, roll each skein in castor sugar. This is uncommon,
and nice.</p>


<h3>16. Pine Apple Sweet.</h3>

<p>Put into a pan a quarter pound of butter, with a
quarter pound of sugar, and two ounces of fine florador;
stir well till it gets quite smooth, then add four slices of
pine-apple that have been mashed to a complete pulp and
passed through a sieve; add a spoonful or two of water, and
let it cook till the florador is quite done and looks clear.
Pour into a mould that has been rinsed in cold water.
When quite cold, turn out with care in a glass dish, surround
the dish with cream, nicely flavoured with pine-apple
flavouring. Decorate with either dried fruits or pretty
sweets.</p>


<h3>17. Apple Sweet.</h3>

<p>Exactly the same as the pine-apple, only using apples
boiled and pulped instead. About four good sized apples
will be needed, and the cream flavoured with lemon.
Decorate in the same way, or with pink and white cocoa-nut
chips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>


<h3>18. Pumpkin Tart.</h3>

<p>Make a puff paste of Coombs' Eureka Flour, and line a
nice sized shallow tin pan with it. Grease the pan well;
prick the paste to prevent it blistering; bake a nice colour
and turn out of the pan. Fill up with a mixture made
thus&mdash;boil one pound of nice ripe yellow pumpkin till
soft; pass it through a sieve. Add to it half a pound of
sugar, the grated rind of a small lemon, the strained juice
of a lemon, the strained juice of an orange, a few cloves.
Boil till it looks nice and clear; take out the cloves, and fill
the mixture into the paste case. Cover over neatly with
well whipped cream, and sprinkle over the top some
chopped pistachio nuts.</p>


<h3>19. Jerusalem Artichoke Jelly.</h3>

<p>Nicely peel one and a half pounds of Jerusalem artichokes,
and throw them into cold water as you do them, else they
discolour. Boil them till soft; drain and mash them to a
complete pulp. Add one pound of castor sugar, and boil
till the artichokes get quite clear. Mix with them a good
deal of vanilla flavouring to overcome the artichoke flavour;
taste it so as to have it right; then put the mixture into a
greased plain mould. Let it get cold before turning out;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
dip it for one instant in very hot water so as to melt the
grease, and turn out in a glass dish. Decorate with nice
dried crystallised fruits. This is nice, and is nutritious.</p>


<h3>20. Banana Pancakes.</h3>

<p>Well mash two bananas to a pulp, mix up a quarter of a
pound of flour, two eggs well beaten, yolks and whites
separately, the whites to a froth; mix with enough milk to
make a stiff batter. Add the bananas to it, and fry in lard
or butter a golden brown; turn over neatly; drain on a
sieve. Serve on a napkin or dish paper; sprinkle well over
each some castor sugar. Serve with sliced lemon.</p>


<h3>21. Coffee Cream Puddings.</h3>

<p>Boil one pint of milk, have ready three ounces of fine
florador mixed with just enough milk to make it like thick
cream; stir it into the milk just as it comes to the boil, stir
well till it gets very thick, stir into it two ounces of fresh
butter, sugar to taste, and enough coffee essence to give it
a good flavour, and a few drops of almond flavouring. Pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
into small plain Darrol moulds that have been rinsed in
water, let them get quite cold and set. Turn them out on a
glass dish; put on the top of each a spoonful of thick
whipped cream, and a <i>glacé</i> cherry in the middle.</p>


<h3>22. Chocolate Cream Puddings.</h3>

<p>The same as the last, but instead of coffee put in two
ounces of <i>good</i> cocoa, flavour with vanilla, and decorate each
little mould with pistachio nuts, blanched and cut in strips,
and stick all over the little moulds like porcupine quills.</p>

<p>Cream may be served with these separately.</p>


<h3>23. Sponge Cake and Banana Pudding.</h3>

<p>Crumble up half a dozen sponge cakes, cover them with
a custard made thus&mdash;two bananas mashed to a pulp, two
eggs well beaten, one pint of milk, sugar to taste, and
vanilla flavouring. Pour over the sponge cakes, stir well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
together, put over the top little dabs of butter here and
there; bake a nice brown. Decorate with pink castor
sugar sprinkled over the top.</p>


<h3>24. Strawberry Cream Pudding.</h3>

<p>Mix some cochineal with ordinary clear plain jelly; line a
plain mould with this. Let it set about a quarter of an inch
thick, then fill up the mould with the following&mdash;half a pound
of strawberries passed through a sieve; mix with one cup
of good thick cream, sugar to taste, and a little liquid jelly.
Mix well together, and pour it in the lined mould. Let it
get quite cold and set; dip the mould into hot water for a
second; whip the water off, and turn out on a glass dish.
Decorate with leaves and flowers of the strawberry.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

<p><sup>[1]</sup> Raspberries can be done the same way.</p>



<h3>25. Hen's Nest Pudding.</h3>

<p>Get some egg shape moulds, fill them with a mixture
made as recipe No. 11, only using fine florador instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>semolina. When cold, turn in thus&mdash;cut into thin chips
some pale lemon and orange peel, so as to resemble straw
as much as possible. Take off all the sugar, put the chips
in a glass dish (a round one is best), form them as much as
possible like a nest, and lay the eggs in them. Serve with a
nice custard in custard glasses separately. This is a pretty
dish when well made. Some use jelly cut in strips instead
of the peel, but it must be very carefully done to look nice.</p>


<h3>26. Fancy Sweets.</h3>

<p>One pound of Coombs' Eureka Flour, half a pound of
sugar, half a pound of butter; mix these well together, then
add four eggs, yolks and whites separately, the whites
beaten to a stiff froth; mix with enough milk to make the
consistence of stiff whipped cream. Take out a third of the
mixture, and colour a nice pink with cochineal, and flavour
with a few drops of almond essence, also put in a few
blanched almonds cut in half; the rest of the mixture
flavour with lemon, and put in some <i>glacé</i> cherries cut in half.
Well butter a square and shallow cake tin, pour in half the
plain mixture with cherries, let it spread and flatten, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
pour the pink mixture on the top of that, let that also
spread and flatten, and then pour the rest of the cherry
mixture on the top; smooth with a wet knife and bake till
set and a nice colour. Leave it for about ten minutes, and
turn out. Let it get quite cold, then cut it into small
squares; smooth the top of each by cutting it quite even.
Then pour over each an icing made thus&mdash;half a pound of confectioners'
sugar, with about two tablespoons of water, stir
well; just let it boil up, and cover the tops of the cakes
smoothly; then sprinkle over the top with pink chip cocoa-nut,
hundreds of thousands, pistachio nuts, or crushed
crystallised violets, each cake with a different decoration.
This is a pretty dish, and very nice.</p>


<h3>27. Sago Jelly.</h3>

<p>Boil a quarter pound of small sago in one quart of water
till quite clear and thick&mdash;if too thick add a little more
water&mdash;but it must be very thick and stiff. Now add a
half pound of sugar, the juice of three oranges strained,
a drop or two of oil of oranges, a pennyworth of saffron
that has been dissolved in a wine glass of boiling water and
strained, some almonds blanched and cut into thin strips.
Mix all well together, and pour into a plain mould that has
been rinsed with cold water. Let it get quite cold and set,
and turn out on a glass dish. Decorate with chow-chow
according to fancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>


<h3>28. Sweet made of Bread.</h3>

<p>Cut some slices of stale bread of a close texture, stamp it
out in neat rounds, soak it in one egg well beaten in a small
cup of milk, fry in lard a golden brown. Now cover over
each any kind of jam that is liked best. Cover with
whipped cream and ornament with a sprinkling of pink
chip cocoa-nut, or to make it of two different colours the
cream can be coloured with a few drops of cochineal, and
ornament with white chip cocoa-nut. This is a very simple
and pretty sweet.</p>


<h3>29. Chestnut Souffle.</h3>

<p>Boil about thirty chestnuts in water till soft. Remove
the shell and outer skin; pound the nuts in a mortar with
a few drops of orange flower water. Well beat the yolks of
three eggs. Add them to the chestnuts with enough sugar
and almond flavouring to taste. Stir into the paste about
one pint of milk. Now beat the whites of the eggs to a
stiff froth, and stir in gradually. Pour the mixture into a
<i>soufflé</i> dish and bake a nice colour. Serve direct from the
oven, as a <i>soufflé</i> falls in getting cold, and is spoilt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>


<h3>30. Treacle Balls.</h3>

<p>A half pound of Coombs' Eureka Flour, a pinch of salt,
half a teaspoon of ginger powder, the grated rind of a small
lemon, a quarter pound of treacle. Mix well together, add
two well beaten eggs, form into small balls, and fry in a
bath of boiling lard a golden brown. The balls will swell a
little in cooking. Sprinkle well over with castor sugar, and
serve.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
